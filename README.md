# SAR-Doppler-user-guide

User guide for SAR Doppler data.

To find the ipynb (jupyter notebook) files go notebooks.

To find the HTML files for the different Jupyter notebooks that collectively constitute the user guide, go to _build/html/notebooks and select your desired notebook.

The user guide is also available as a PDF. However, with the in place structure of the manual, it is preferable to open it as HTML, in indvidual jupyter notebooks or as a jupyter-book. This has to do with certain code snippets and outputs.

Here is the link to the jupyter-book documentation: https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html
